# hello-world
Learning GitHub doing the HW jiggy.

I do art, poetry and other creative things.  I thought I would learn how to code.
They say Jack of all trades, Master of none is not a good thing to be.
I think having multiple skills is like that well balanced character
that can solo through adventures most of the time.  Mastering is great.
Jacking is just plain fun.  However, it is time to put my passion for creation
into a skill set that can actually sustain me, my family and allow me to 
contribute to society in a positive way.
